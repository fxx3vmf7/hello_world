#volcabulary:

#commit, pull (1st time: clone), push (1st time: publish), remote, repo (local vs remote)


# practice vocab:

#Hey Bob! Did you start the analysis yet? If you did, can you publish your repo
# to Github so that I can clone it to my computer?

# Yes, it's already on Github. But give me until noon to push my latest commits.

#Great! I will pull the repo now to look. At noon, I will clone your more recent commits.

#main, branches

#merge conflicts is painful. A solutin is to commit and push OFTEN

#fork and clone repo, fork someone else' repo to my account, then clone to local repo
